// Complete the questions below; we'll go over these at our next class meeting.
// The skills covered in these questions are DIRECTLY related to the notes sheet
// called Basics of JS.

// 1. Declare a variable whose value CANNOT change called `favCourse`
// Note: This variable should be a string.
const favCourse = `AP Lit`
// 2. Log the value of `favCourse` to the console
console.log(favCourse);
// 3. Create a variable whose value CAN change called `grade`
// Note: this variable should be an integer
let grade = `100`
// 4. Log the value of `grade` to the console
console.log(grade);
// 5. Create a variable whose value is a Boolean called `isHope`
// You should set it dependent upon if there is/is not hope for your grade
// in said course.
let isHope = true
// 6. Log the value of `isHope` to the console.
console.log(isHope);
// 7. Write a statement using the format below wherein your variables are "plugged in"
// The console should read: My favorite course is Geography. My grade is a 98. Hope: true.
// If you're drawing a blank on this skill, this documentation will help:
